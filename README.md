# wp-thumb-extractor
It fetched thumb of specified size from first video or images of wordpress post.
This is the git repo for my wordpress plugin [amtyThumb](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amtythumb/). I created it 4-5 years ago and it has more than 3K downloads.

## Description

It helps you to extract images or first frame of a video from any wordpress post and resize them in thumbnail of any preferable size. 

It cached the image which can be removed on user's wish.

It is just an API and can be used by other wordpress plugins.

#### Support

I am pausing it's development due to other priorities. However I'll keep supporting for any bug, small features, and any request.
